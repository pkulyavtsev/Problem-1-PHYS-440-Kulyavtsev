//Write code to calculate the
//volume of a sphere, the surface area of a sphere, the volume
//of a bounding box, and the surface area of the bounding box of the sphere. Use version
//control, so you can revert between the three examples.
//In your first example program, write the code poorly.
//In your second example program, refactor the code so it takes user input and is more
//clearly written.
//In your third example program, refactor the code so it is reusable. Use reusable classes
//that are well documented.
